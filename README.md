# Using TestZeus and Applitools to Test Salesforce Apps

This repo has a short example of how to test a Salesforce app with TestZeus and Applitools. 

## Development

It's recommended that you use an IDE like [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) since it has support for Maven (build systems), 
Java (programming language) and JUnit (testing framework). 

## Deployment

Assuming you are using an IDE, you can either run `AccountsTest.java` for a basic TestZeus test, or `AccountsApplitoolsTest.java` 
for an example of TestZeus used with Applitools.
